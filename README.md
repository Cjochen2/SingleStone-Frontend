# SingleStone-Frontend-TechTest

Below I have attached a deployed link hosted through GitHub Pages. Which will show the page up and running as intended.

# Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the Repo locally. I personally utilize GitBash and will clone it utilizing the command:
    git clone {Repo Url}
2. Utilizing your prefered package manager install the dependancies. I utilize NPM command:
    npm i
3. Start the react application. Using NPM the command is:
    npm start

## Dependancies
    The only dependencies out side of React and its associated defaults are
        axios - https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios
        gh-pages - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages

## About the Design
    I designed this front end application utilizing React and Javascript. Axios was used to handle the API call to the given API. gh-pages was used for deployment of the application for ease of viewing. I broke the various parts of the application down into components that could be individually styled and modified. While not heavily displayed I used React Hooks vs the older React constructor style. If there are any questions please feel free to reach out to me and I would be happy to answer.
